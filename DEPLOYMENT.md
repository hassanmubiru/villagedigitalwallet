Your Village Digital Wallet is ready for deployment to the Celo blockchain! Here's how to deploy:

### Prerequisites

1. **Get Testnet CELO tokens**:
   - Visit [Celo Alfajores Faucet](https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores)
   - Enter your wallet address to receive free testnet CELO for gas fees

2. **Configure your wallet**:
   - Make sure your `.env` file has your private key configured
   - Never commit your private key to version control

### Deployment Commands

```bash
./deploy-celo.sh --network=celo
```

### Verify Deployment

./verify-deployment.sh --network=alfajores
```

### After Deployment

1. Contract addresses will be automatically updated in `app/utils/contractAddresses.ts`
2. The frontend will connect to your deployed contracts
3. You can verify contracts on [CeloScan](https://alfajores.celoscan.io) (testnet) or [CeloScan](https://celoscan.io) (mainnet)

### Network Information
