## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install additional Phase 2 dependencies
npm install ethers recharts @openzeppelin/contracts
```

### 2. Smart Contract Deployment
```typescript
import { deployNewSavingsGroup } from './app/lib/smartContractManager';

// Deploy a new savings group contract
const deployment = await deployNewSavingsGroup(
  "Village Farmers Cooperative",
  "0xAdminAddress...",
  50,    // Minimum contribution (CELO)
  5000   // Maximum loan amount (CELO)
);
```

### 3. Mobile Money Configuration
```typescript
// Configure provider credentials in .env.local
MTN_API_KEY=your_key
MTN_API_SECRET=your_secret
AIRTEL_API_KEY=your_key
AIRTEL_API_SECRET=your_secret
```

### 4. Credit Scoring Setup
```typescript
import { creditScoring } from './app/lib/creditScoring';

// Calculate credit score
const score = await creditScoring.calculateCreditScore(userData);

// Auto-approve loan
const approval = await creditScoring.autoApproveLoan(score, amount, duration);
```

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- **Reentrancy Protection:** All state-changing functions use ReentrancyGuard
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions with OpenZeppelin AccessControl
- **Integer Overflow:** SafeMath library for all arithmetic operations
- **Audit Requirements:** Contracts should be audited before mainnet deployment

### API Security
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens for API access
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse of credit scoring APIs
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Webhook Verification:** Cryptographic signature verification

### Data Privacy
